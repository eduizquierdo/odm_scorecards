# odm_scorecards
Asset to extend IBM ODM to support scorecards tables.

This asset is for customer woh ask about scorecards.
Scorecards have been deprecated in the product. 
This asset provides some support for scorecards implemented ad DTs.
The asset supports scorecards with reasoning codes and with weight and max score.
The part that we're are missing from a scorecard in the graphical representation. In this case is different: a score card is represented by a rule package with a set of DTs each one contrinuting to the score based on a different attribute of te model.

I made only basic testing.
Comments for improvements are welcome.
